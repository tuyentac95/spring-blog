<p><em>Ripple... If you started in Crypto back in 2016 or 2017 you probably grabbed a good amount of Ripple already. As we sit waiting, and waiting.....and waiting for a price increase I decided to dig a little bit and do some in depth research.</em></p><hr /><p>Why we believe that XRP will never be a high valued coin.</p><p>So let's take a look at what Ripple aims to do....Well, payment remittance, but for who? Big banks and corporations! So if the big banks and corps want to send money across the world they can do it cheaper right? Correct.</p><p>So, this lead us to believe that Ripple itself or the XRP coin will never become a high valued coin or store of value such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This is not to say the coin won't fluctuate of course but we strongly believe the XRP coin will remain under the $1.00 mark for quite some time.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.publish0x.com/prod/fs/images/3351837526a7638aadc55c4240c0e53c3fa375a39e56dc51b5be3c4ec05d4a82.jpeg" style="height:337px; width:600px" /></p><p>In fact, with how they plan to use XRP across the globe it is really unlikely that the coin itself will increase much at all. The coin needs to remain functional and affordable on a very large scale. This cannot keep functionality for big banks or corporations if the coin value becomes to high.</p><p>Now, with all that being said, just look into Brad Garlinghouse. Watch some of the youtube clips and find some articles for yourself. This mans plan for XRP was never to help anyone become wealthy, learn crypto or usher in the new future. This man's main goal was to save the wealthiest people money the world over.</p><p>This is just our 2 cents but we decided a long time ago to stop pouring money into XRP coin. From the level we are at now it is likely the coin will increase but we highly doubt we will see a $1.00 XRP for a very, very long time.</p><p><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong></p><p>If you want to collect Free Crypto all day long, check out our website for a huge list of free Crypto services.</p><p>Happy Coining,</p><p>BlueSkyCrypto</p><p>Like, Tip & Follow to Win!?</p>
