<p>At the height of the covid-19 pandemic, we saw the use of 3D printing around the world to quickly make respirators combining very diverse parts. Without going too far,? some automobile manufacturers used it to make key parts in respirators made from windshield wipers and to make face shields. This is a technology that has been talked about a lot in recent years. At first, it seemed like everyone would have a 3D printer at home. But even though the initial expectations have not been met, it is a technology that is beginning to be applied in areas of great interest and can change the rules of international trade.? Below I review the origins of 3D printing, in which sectors it is advancing and how we can get started in this exciting technology.</p><p><strong>Digitization of physical objects: the union of the software industry and materials science</strong></p><p>Three-dimensional printing is based, like any other technology, on more than previous ones. Its beginnings date back to the 70s and 80s of the last century, as an evolution of paper printers that print in two dimensions: wide and long. Another of the technologies it is inspired by is the machining of parts in the industry, with numerical control machines, such as lathes and milling machines. In this type of machine, metal blocks are introduced - also of more materials, such as wood and plastic - to which material is removed following programmed plans, to give them the desired shape. Instead of removing material from a block, 3D printers add - print - material in successive layers to the desired shape. That is why it is also known as additive manufacturing.</p><p>In short, it is a technology that digitizes physical objects using three-dimensional CAD designed models on computers. It represents the union between the software industry and the materials science, because the latter must provide those substances that allow printing, giving the necessary physical properties, such as being able to be melted, solidify quickly after printing and present the resistance to the required efforts. The materials mainly used are polymers, such as plastics, resins and carbon fibers. However, progress is being made in the use of metals to make high-strength parts and in the printing of cells to produce biological tissues.</p><p><strong>Advantages and disadvantages of a potentially disruptive technology</strong></p><p>The advantages of this technology are many. Currently, most manufactured products contain parts manufactured in various parts of the world. These parts have to travel long distances to reach the place of assembly of the final product - such as a bicycle, a car or a washing machine. The advantage of 3D printing is that it allows you to work without transporting physical objects. Instead, the three-dimensional models developed by the companies are quickly transmitted over the Internet and at zero cost, which can all be printed at the same time and directly at the assembly site. This allows less materials, less energy and less labor to be used, which can lead to cheaper products and lower environmental impact, as they are produced closer to the place of consumption. In Europe, and in the Western World in general, this technology is seen with great interest as a tool that can allow reindustrialization, reducing the current heavy dependence on Asian manufacturing. This can completely change the rules of international trade, significantly reducing the needs of sea, air and road transport.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.publish0x.com/prod/fs/images/d4140e121d4a1307c011f1cc63ea685ffaa6da0d1199c38a43b04ee14bd39d0c.jpeg" /></p><p>One of the other advantages is that it allows for smaller productions. Personalization is one of the big current trends in commerce. If until now we have consumed products that were produced in large quantities to offer a lower price, today consumers are asking for more specific products that suit their specific needs and even more exclusive, aligned with their personality and lifestyle. They can also be made more frequently, so you can start making a small production of a product and, if successful, make one-off productions. This eliminates overproduction. Currently manufactured products are made up of millions of different parts, and we often have to throw away a product because some of the damaged parts are not found or have stopped being manufactured. 3D printing can preserve the blueprints of these pieces and print them on demand, preventing us from having to throw them away.</p><p>But not everything is an advantage. If personalization is an advantage for the consumer, it also represents an increase in logistics travel to cities. Instead of having large trucks that deliver a large volume of the same product, we move on to vans and motorcycles that deliver a unique product to each customer, as is already the case with e-commerce, which has caused increased traffic to many cities. As long as transportation is not electrified from renewable energy, it means an increase in pollution on our streets. In fact, many experts criticize the lack of evidence that a manufacturing sector based on 3D printers involves cost savings and a decrease in environmental impact throughout the global product cycle. The impact on employment should not be underestimated either. This technology is often considered in the context of fully automated plants that require very little labor. Another major drawback, for now, is that printing is slow. On medium and high complexity parts, printing may take several hours. In addition, technology needs to improve accuracy, as reproducibility is difficult. Users, once the map has been downloaded, often have to make several attempts, adjusting the printer settings, to obtain the desired result. And from the buyer?s point of view, the final look of printed products often has an unattractive finish. Surfaces are uneven and rough, rather than completely smooth. Finally, you also need to think about the potential misuses of 3D printing. The circulation of plans to make illegal firearms has been detected. Criminal groups, terrorists, and conflicting individuals could easily build a firearm with a standard printer.</p><p><strong>The main applications of a revolutionary technology</strong></p><p>Despite the problems, 3D printing technology is used in many industries, with billions in sales each year. Possibly the most widely used is in prototyping. Many companies today have 3D printers for the development of new products. Not only because it allows them to make any piece and create successive improvements, but also because it ostensibly reduces development time. Very often, companies had to order parts in China, wait to receive them by courier, check how they work, make modifications, and start the cycle again. With a 3D printer, they can do all this in the office the same day. And since technology allows for more complex designs, along with machine learning, they have achieved bolder and more efficient designs when it comes to withstanding stresses and forces, especially with the use of metal. The surprise was that some of the new designs produce biological-looking pieces, showing that we still have a lot to learn from nature to optimize products.</p><p>Sectors such as aviation and rail transport are also beginning to take advantage of this technology. In this case because these are vehicles that are produced small, almost handcrafted. Companies like Airbus have begun to design and make very specific parts that, because they are compact, save weight, a critical aspect in air transport. In the case of Germany, railway operators have resorted to 3D printing to manufacture spare seat replacements, saving themselves from having to accumulate stocks for years or fearing supplier closures. The current trend, however, is to go one step further towards mass production. Given the progress, the automotive industry, the paradigm of large-scale production, are beginning to consider its use. We must not forget the aerospace sector. The way to print tools in space and even rockets is already being investigated. Thus, the first human missions to Mars, or beyond, could make repairs or expand the fleet of ships without having to make large shipments with tools and various spare ship parts.</p><p>Another promising sector and where the first steps are being taken is in medicine. As we said, personalization is one of the great advantages of this technology. In medicine, more and more people go to specific treatments than to generic ones. Thus genes are genetically sequenced to design the most effective drugs to attack them. The initial approach in relation to 3D printers in the field of health, still in its very early stages, is to address the lack of organs and tissues. The first tests of organic printing, such as skin, have begun, which can then be transplanted into patients who require it; and parts of the body, such as the outer part of the ear, for those who have suffered a mutilation or congenital defect. The ultimate goal is to be able to increase the complexity and end up printing whole organs. Other candidates to take advantage of this technology are pastry, using chocolate, and pasta.</p><p><strong>How to get started</strong></p><p>What if we want to get started? Basically, we need three elements: a printer, a printing filament, and the blueprints of the models or parts to be reproduced. Printing companies usually provide models, while we can buy the filaments in specialty stores, through manufacturers and stores like Amazon.</p><p>There is a wide range of home 3D printers, with a wide price range. We can find from about $200, and the most sophisticated models can exceed $5,000. However, ease of use, especially when starting out, and the support community are points to consider. Also the quality of construction, such as incorporating metal parts instead of plastics, or already assembled. For this reason, one of the printers recommended to start with, although not the cheapest ($1,500), is the Lulzbot Mini 2. Easy to set up and with quality motors and elements, you can use various materials printing. It also has a self-leveling base and allows models to be inserted via SD cards. In addition, it has a high print speed, which can be good if we want to market prints later. If we have a more limited budget to get started, Anycubic's 3D Photon is our choice. At around $200, it allows you to create small models, but with good quality. In this price range, we also have the Comgrow Creality Ender 5, for about $ 350. However, if we want the most complete one, the Makerbot Replicator + is one of the candidates (from $2,500). If, on the other hand, we want to make professional use of it, we can value the extra features of the Ultimaker 3 ($ 3,500): double filament printing, which allows us to print with different materials at the same time, obtaining more complex pieces, and a wider range of filaments ?ABS, nylon, copolyester, etc.?, in addition to having four resolutions / print speed, depending on the resulting quality we need, and being very quiet.</p><p>As we can see, although the popularity of 3D printing has not gone as fast as initially thought, the use has a solid foundation, is evolving rapidly and has great disruptive potential. Maybe starting with a home printer can end up founding a great company. It wouldn't be the first time someone had changed the world from a garage</p>
